*Only for Mellanox switches

== Switch Configuration

This solution uses Mellanox SN2010 switches running Onyx. The Mellanox switches are configured using an Ansible playbook. Prior to running the Ansible playbook, you should perform the initial configuration of the switches manually:

. Install and cable the switches to the uplink switch, compute, and storage nodes.
. Power on the switches and configure them with the following details:
.. Host name
.. Management IP and gateway
.. NTP
. Log into the Mellanox switches and run the following commands:
+
....
configuration write to pre-ansible
configuration write to post-ansible
....
+
The `pre-ansible` configuration file created can be used to restore the switchâ€™s configuration to the state before the Ansible playbook execution.
+
The switch configuration for this solution is stored in the `post-ansible` configuration file.
+
. The configuration playbook for Mellanox switches that follows best practices and requirements for NetApp HCI can be downloaded from url[https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/hci-toolkit^].
[NOTE]
The toolkit also provides a playbook to setup Cisco Nexus switches with similar best practices and requirements for NetApp HCI
[NOTE]
Additional guidance on populating the variables and executing the playbook is available in the respective switch README.md file.
+
. Fill out the credentials to access the switches and variables needed for the environment. The following text is a sample of the variable file for this solution.
+

[NOTE]
The fingerprint for the switchâ€™s key must match with that present in the host machine from where the playbook is being executed. To ensure this, add the key to `/root/. ssh/known_host` or any other appropriate location.

== Rollback the Switch Configuration

. In case of any timeout failures or partial configuration, run the following command to roll back the switch to the initial state.
+

....
configuration switch-to pre-ansible
....
+
[NOTE]
This operation requires a reboot of the switch.

. Switch the configuration to the state before running the Ansible playbook.
+

....
configuration delete post-ansible
....

. Delete the post-ansible file that had the configuration from the Ansible playbook.
+

....
configuration write to post-ansible
....

. Create a new file with the same name post-ansible, write the pre-ansible configuration to it, and switch to the new configuration to restart configuration.

== IP Address Requirements

The deployment of the NetApp HCI inferencing platform with VMware and Kubernetes requires multiple IP addresses to be allocated. The following table lists the number of IP addresses required. Unless otherwise indicated, addresses are assigned automatically by NDE.

|===
|IP Address Quantity |Details |VLAN ID |IP Address

| One per storage and compute node*
|HCI terminal user interface (TUI) addresses
|16
|
| One per vCenter Server (VM)
|vCenter Server management address
|3488
|
| One per management node (VM)
|Management node IP address
|
|
| One per ESXi host
|ESXi compute management addresses
|
|
| One per storage/witness node
|NetApp HCI storage node management addresses

|===

*This validation requires the initial setup of the first storage node TUI address. NDE automatically assigns the TUI address for subsequent nodes.

== DNS and Timekeeping Requirement

Depending on your deployment, you might need to prepare DNS records for your NetApp HCI system. NetApp HCI requires a valid NTP server for timekeeping; you can use a publicly available time server if you do not have one in your environment.

This validation involves deploying NetApp HCI with a new VMware vCenter Server instance using a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Before deployment,  you must have one Pointer (PTR) record and one Address (A) record created on the DNS server.
